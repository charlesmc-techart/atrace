# A Trace

A collection of scripts I wrote as the Technical Lead for _A Trace_, a 3D animated short film about a young girl with an absent father. It was my thesis project at San Jos√© State Universtiy's BFA Animation & Illustration program, A.Y. 2022-2023.

All of these were intended to be used in Autodesk Maya 2023. Scripts in the root directory were used directly by the artists in the team, while those under `scriptNodes/` were put in script nodes that executed upon opening Maya scenes.
